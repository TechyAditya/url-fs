# url-fs
## Installation
```bash
sudo apt install fuse -y
pip install fusepy
```
## Usage
Currently, the dictionary of the files are passed as parameter inside the main.py. 
## Future Plans
- Read from json
- Pass json file location as parameter
- Folders support
- Proper filename from url
- Frontend ui to manage instances of mount points

## Motive
I really want to play direct download links to plex media player. So, I made this as temporary solution to my problem. After successful tests in cloud providers like pixeldrain (it's damn cheap), I will continue to maintain and finish my goals. 

In the end, I simply want to stream 4k 70ish GB url files on plex server without the need of downloading :)
